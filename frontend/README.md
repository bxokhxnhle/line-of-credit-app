# Frontend Application

This directory contains the frontend part of the application built with React and Vite.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Development Server**: After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server with:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the Vite development server and you can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build of the application in the `dist` directory.
